## 📖 Project Background

The base structure was **inspired by a tutorial from  
[Thapa Technical](https://www.youtube.com/@ThapaTechnical)**.  
I used the tutorial as a learning scaffold and then:

- Rewrote all placeholder text with my own meaningful copy  
- Adjusted padding, margins, fonts and colours to my taste  
- Added a multi‑page navbar and routed `about`, `services`, and `contact` pages  
- Replaced/added icons and images  
- Ensured accessibility attributes and semantic HTML  
- Tweaked design according to my preferences and understanding


This project is **strictly for educational and portfolio use**.
